They say it's matter of time
A thousand days and the sun won't shine
Before I come back to you
 
I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way
 
For you love I will go far
I wanna be wherever you are
I know I'm coming back for you
 
Our love is a river long
The best right in a million wrongs
I know I'm coming back to you

And I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home
I'm making my way
 
I go solo, oh I go solo
I'm making my way home, I'm making my way
 
And I'm happy, nothing's going to stop me
I'm making my way home
I'm making my way
 
I go solo, oh I go solo
I'm making my way home
I'm making my way
